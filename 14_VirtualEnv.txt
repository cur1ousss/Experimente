# Virtual Environments
	to separate package versions between different projects

pip is a package manager for Python. 
venv is an environment manager for Python. 
conda is both a package and environment manager and is language agnostic.

- pip install virtualenv

- mkdir Environments
- cd !$
- virtualenv Project1_env
	# installs basic setuptools and pip tools

# to activate new created python Environment
- source Project1_env/bin/activate

# to make sure in correct Environment
- which python
	# outputs points to python in created Environment
	 - conda deactivate # deactivate base package
	 - which python # output points to global python

- deactivate
	# to get out of local created Environment

# delete Environment and project
- rm -rf Project1_env

# new Environment and Project with Specific Python version
- virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.6 Project1_env
	# to confirm version 
	 - python --version

# DON'T PUT PROJECT FILES INSIDE Environment Folder Created 
	why?
